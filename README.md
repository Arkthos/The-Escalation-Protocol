# 🛡️ The Escalation Protocol
### _For those who fix first, document second, and answer to no one but uptime._

Welcome to the chaos.

This is my vault of raw, battle-worn knowledge from the trenches of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) support.  
Born from busted endpoints, cursed telemetry, and support cases that broke both logic and spirit, this repo is my personal rebellion against:

- Internal wikis no one reads  
- Documentation review queues that move slower than a OneDrive sync on hotel Wi-Fi  
- Governance models written for developer teams, not support engineers  
- Formatting rules designed more for Copilot than for humans  
- And the soul-crushing experience of watching great knowledge die in private chats

If you’ve ever spent hours solving a problem only to realize that *no one else will ever see that fix*—I built this for you.

## 💥 Why This Exists

Because knowledge should be sacred.  
In support, it should be **the currency**, right after customer obsession.

Every interaction, every ticket, every hair-pulling investigation—should feed the knowledge base.  
But in my org, it doesn't. Because now it’s all about formatting for ingestion, not usefulness.

> Shareability, clarity, and actual actionability were never the framework.  
> They were the exception—for people like me, who put in the elbow grease.  
> And now even that option is gone, buried under Copilot’s hunger for perfectly structured metadata.

So I said screw it.  
If the system won't let me share knowledge the right way, I’ll do it my way.  
Messy. Honest. Fast. Human.
This is my initiative. My protest. My contribution.  

Long story short I built this place.  
To fight that decay.  
To make knowledge **accessible**, **findable**, **actionable**, and **human** again.

Here’s hoping that when a manager inevitably stumbles across this, they get the point—  
and don’t immediately ask for my head.

**This is documentation with teeth.**

## ⚙️ What You'll Find Here

- Real-world MDE support workflows that actually solve things
- Diagnostic methods forged in the fires of "we have no telemetry"
- Detection logic and scripts written at 2am out of spite
- Commentary, rants, and occasional jokes at the expense of broken policy engines

---

## 🧠 Who This Is For

- Support engineers who are tired of treating Teams chats as source control
- Security pros who want **answers**, not architecture diagrams
- Curious nerds who want to see how the sausage is made—and maybe cook their own

---

## 🧭 How to Use This Repo

- Start in the folders: `troubleshooting/`, `scripts/`, `detection-logic/`
- Read the comments. The gold is in the context.
- **Never deploy blindly.** This is a map, not GPS.
- Contribute if you’ve got something to share. This isn’t just a rant—it’s a revolution.

## ⚠️ LEGENDARY DISCLAIMER (READ THIS OR REGRET IT)

This content is shared in good faith, powered by pain, coffee, and pure technical spite.  
That does **not** mean it’s safe to use without a brain.

> **🧯 Don’t be a dumbass.**  
> If you take anything from this repo and run it in production without testing—  
> **you are lighting the fuse on your own dumpster fire.** I’m not responsible, and I’m not bringing marshmallows.

### I do **not** take responsibility for (but not limited to):

- Broken tenants  
- Deleted data  
- Detection logic that gains sentience  
- Alert floods that wake up the entire SOC  
- Bricked endpoints that refuse to boot out of spite
- CISO expontaneuos combustion  
- SIEMs that scream like banshees before falling over  
- Intune policies looping into the ninth circle of hell  
- Scripts that nuke your GPOs because you typo’d a path  
- Licensing behavior that makes no sense to anyone on Earth  
- Support tickets I end up owning because you didn’t read this  
- “Quick tests” in production that spawn incident bridges  
- Clippy whispering “I warned you” from your logs  
- An AI-powered internal review bot flagging your work as noncompliant while your customer bleeds

Let me be crystal clear:  
**You’re not paying me. There’s no SLA. There’s no safety net. And I am absolutely not your scapegoat.**

This is not official.  
This is not sanitized.  
This is not bulletproof.  

It’s a toolkit.  
It’s a war journal.  
It’s **OURS.** - *(but mostly mine)*

## 🤬 Before You Go Full Karen

Feel like complaining? Here’s your three-step protocol:

**Step 1**: Call AT&T.  
**Step 2**: Yell at that poor, overworked, underpaid outsourced soul who’s just trying to survive off a job that eats his soul twelve hours a day while being blamed for things way above his pay grade by people like you without a choice for a better life, because the politicians in his country stole even the nails holding the chairs to the floor.  (Yes, I have been that guy too).  
**Step 3**: When you feel like being human again come back and let´s make shit happen.

## 📬 Contributions & Feedback

Pull requests are welcome. But bring real stuff—no fluff, no ego, no “let me just fix this comma” energy.  
We’re building something better than the system here. Keep it sharp. Keep it human.

## 🔥 Final Words

This repo exists Because customers deserve better. 

Because we can’t keep losing valuable insights to red tape and review queues.

Because I got tired of being told no.  
No, that’s not formatted right.  
No, that can’t go in the wiki.  
No, that’s not aligned with our ingestion goals.  

So here’s my **yes**:  
Yes to clarity.  
Yes to usefulness.  
Yes to doing the right thing, even if it’s unofficial.


Test responsibly.  
Document fiercely.  
Fight the entropy.

Welcome to the somewhat controlled chaos.

Your friendly, burnt-the-f***-out MDE Support Engineer,  
**– Arkthos**
