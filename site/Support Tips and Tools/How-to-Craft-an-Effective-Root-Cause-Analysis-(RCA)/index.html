<p>Hi, Support Engineer about to do an RCA or LQR,</p>
<p>I just wanted to share some tips from my experience to help improve our communication with customers, especially for RCAs and LQRs. This isn't a must-follow; always prioritize your organization´s guidance. Furthermore, I know we often can't get all the information because we didn't find it, didn't need it, or it came from external sources. But when possible, try to document as much as you can to improve CSAT and avoid negative perceptions.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention and support. Feedback is always welcome.<br />
