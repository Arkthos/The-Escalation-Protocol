Hi, Support Engineer about to do an RCA or LQR,

I just wanted to share some tips from my experience to help improve our communication with customers, especially for RCAs and LQRs. This isn't a must-follow; always prioritize your organization´s guidance. Furthermore, I know we often can't get all the information because we didn't find it, didn't need it, or it came from external sources. But when possible, try to document as much as you can to improve CSAT and avoid negative perceptions.

Thank you for your attention and support. Feedback is always welcome.

# Steps to Craft an Effective RCA

## Problem Statement

Clearly define the issue, including the time of occurrence, systems affected, and business impact. A clear problem statement sets the context for the RCA and helps the customer understand the scope and severity of the issue. If you follow good case notation practices, this should be almost ready to go. Here is how I do it in case you'd like to pull some tips from there: **[Effective Case Note template](https://github.com/Arkthos/The-Escalation-Protocol/wiki/Effective-Case-Note-template)**.
