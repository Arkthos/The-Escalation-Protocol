## üß† 2. Detection Logic & Core Concepts

A well-structured rule must align with how Defender evaluates alerts. Here are the essential pieces:

### üõ† 2.1 Key Elements

- **Alert**: A signal triggered by Defender, carrying metadata such as AlertDisplayName, DetectionSource, and a list of Evidence items.  
  ![EICAR test file malware alert was prevented by Microsoft Defender; alert is resolved.](https://github.com/Arkthos/The-Escalation-Protocol/blob/main/Wiki%20snapshots/Image%20%281%29.png)

- **Evidence / IOC**: Entities that cause the alert‚Äîfiles, IPs, users, devices, etc.  
  ![Screenshot showing malware detection details for a file named 'X5O!...EICAR...'](https://github.com/Arkthos/The-Escalation-Protocol/blob/main/Wiki%20snapshots/Image%20%282%29.png)

- **Property**: Describes an attribute of the evidence, like ProcessName, DeviceTag, or SHA1.  
  ![Malware detection details of EICAR test file including SHA1 hash, file path, and unsigned signer.](https://github.com/Arkthos/The-Escalation-Protocol/blob/main/Wiki%20snapshots/Image%20%283%29.png)

- **Condition**: A filter built with Evidence + Property + Operator + Value, forming the logic behind every rule.  
  ![Screenshot of a conditions panel from a security alert filtering interface.](https://github.com/Arkthos/The-Escalation-Protocol/blob/main/Wiki%20snapshots/Image%20%284%29.png)

- **Group/Sub-group**: Containers to structure AND/OR logic. Sub-groups allow nesting for more granular logic.  
  ![Screenshot of a security rule configuration interface showing grouped conditions.](https://github.com/Arkthos/The-Escalation-Protocol/blob/main/Wiki%20snapshots/Image%20%285%29.png)

- **Service Source**: The Defender product where the alert originated (e.g., Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Office 365, Identity, etc.).  
  ![A screenshot of an XDR alert highlighting the service source of the alert](https://github.com/Arkthos/The-Escalation-Protocol/blob/main/Wiki%20snapshots/Image%20%286%29.png)

- **Action**:  
  - **Resolve**: Keeps alert visible but closed  
  - **Hide**: Fully suppresses alert from queues and dashboards

### üßÆ 2.2 Evaluation Order

Defender evaluates logic like a code compiler:

- Innermost sub-groups first
- Then parent groups, evaluated left to right



### ‚ùó 2.3 Logic Examples
Alert tuning logic works much like a mathematical truth function based on Boolean logic.
![Mathematical representation of the rule evaluation logic](https://github.com/Arkthos/The-Escalation-Protocol/blob/main/Wiki%20snapshots/Image%20(8).png)

We could also see it as:
```
Rule = Group1 AND Group2
  Group1 = (Condition1 OR Condition2)
  Group2 = (SubGroup1 AND SubGroup2)
```

üîç **Interpretation**:

- A tuning rule only activates (i.e., hides or resolves an alert) if ALL specified conditions are true.
- If any single condition (e.g., A, B, C, or D) is false, the alert remains active.

üß† Think of it like an AND gate in logic circuits or a compound condition in code:

```python
if (DeviceTag == 'RedTeam' and ProcessName == 'nmap.exe') and (SHA1 == '123abc' and DetectionSource == 'AV'):
    action = 'Resolve'
else:
    action = 'Keep Active'
```

This logic ensures precision in alert suppression‚Äîonly known-safe patterns get filtered, and all other cases stay visible for review.

#### Let‚Äôs see it in action:
![Graphic representation of alert tuning logic using nested logical groups. A parent group with an AND operator contains two sub-groups (also using AND logic). Sub-group 1 specifies FileName = EICAR-Test-File and SHA1 = 4206473fa51738e6d713b28fbb6dc28193a1d851. Sub-group 2 specifies FolderPath = C:\Users\adminboy\Desktop and DetectionSource = Antivirus. All conditions must be met for the alert rule to trigger.](https://github.com/Arkthos/The-Escalation-Protocol/blob/main/Wiki%20snapshots/Image%20(9).png)

This rule has:

- A Parent Group with an AND operator
- Two Sub-groups, both using AND logic
- For the rule to match (i.e., suppress an alert), all conditions in both sub-groups must be true.

üß† **Interpreted Logic**:


Sub-group 1 must match:
```
- FileName = EICAR-Test-File
- SHA1 = 4206473fa51738e6d713b28fbb6dc28193a1d851
```
AND Sub-group 2 must match:
```
- FolderPath = C:\Users\adminboy\Desktop
- DetectionSource = Antivirus
```

```
Match = (FileName == "EICAR-Test-File" AND SHA1 == "4206473f...") AND (FolderPath == "C:\\Users\\adminboy\\Desktop" AND DetectionSource == "Antivirus")
```

If any one of those four conditions is not true, the rule will not match, and the alert will remain active.

This nested logic blocks help you suppress known safe behaviors without exposing your environment to blind spots.


#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Practical Caveats**: 
‚ö†Ô∏è Rules do not apply retroactively‚Äîonly new alerts are matched. Understanding this order is key to debugging failed rules and avoiding logic traps.

‚ö†Ô∏è The field `FolderPath` may be enriched-only in some alert types (i.e., visible in the UI but not present in raw telemetry). If so, even if the rest of the conditions match, the rule may fail silently.

üìå **Recommendation**: Always verify each field with the Autofill function before using it in tuning logic.



## üéØ 3. Creating Rules with Clear Intent

When crafting a rule, go beyond syntax. Focus on intention and scope:

ü§î **Key Questions**:

- Is this alert frequent enough to justify suppression?
- Is there a shared tag, behavior, or indicator to scope it?
- Could this behavior be safe in one context and risky in another?

‚úÖ **Best Practices**:

- Start with `Resolve`: Never hide alerts without a test phase
- Use environmental filters like DeviceTag, DeviceGroup, or UserTag
- Leverage Autofill to extract reliable raw fields from existing alerts
- Avoid overfitting: A rule that‚Äôs too specific will stop working when harmless variation occurs

## üß™ 4. Lifecycle Case Study: Red Team Scanner

The alert tuning rule lifecycle follows a structured path to ensure accuracy, safety, and governance. Below is a visual-aligned version of the flow:

üß≠ **Scenario**: The Red Team's nightly vulnerability scans generate alerts flagged as malicious scanning behavior.

üìù **Full Lifecycle**:

üîç **1. Discover**:

- **Alert**: Port scanning behavior
- **IOC**: ProcessName = nmap.exe, DeviceTag = RedTeam

üõ† **2. Build & Resolve**:

- Use Autofill from the alert
- Manually add:
  - DeviceTag = RedTeam
  - ProcessName = nmap.exe
- Set Action = Resolve
- Name the rule: LT-RedTeam-Nmap-Resolve

üß™ **3. Pilot**:

- Monitor via: Settings ‚Üí Alert Tuning ‚Üí Associated Alerts
- Check for any unintended matches or gaps

üöÄ **4. Promote & Hide**:

- If pilot results are clean, change action to Hide
- Document rationale and continue observation

üõ† **5. Audit & Tweak**:

- **Monthly**: Export alert metrics and verify impact
- **Quarterly**: Review Red Team activity for relevance

üóÉ **6. Retire Rule**:

- If rule is no longer needed (e.g., tool decommissioned), deactivate or delete

üìå At any stage, if behavior changes or false positives emerge, loop back to ‚ÄúBuild & Resolve‚Äù for refinement.

## üß≠ 6. Real-World Logic Patterns

| üß© Pattern | üí° Logic Example | üåç Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Safe-list internal file hashes | `(SHA1 = abc OR SHA1 = def OR SHA1 = ghi)` | Used to suppress alerts on trusted internal executables like custom IT tools or in-house scripts. |
| Restrict risky tools to labs | `(Process = nmap AND DeviceTag = Lab)` | Allows the use of penetration testing tools like nmap only within lab environments, avoiding alerts in production. |
| Handle dual-use tools in production | `(DeviceTag = Prod AND (Process = nmap OR Process = masscan))` | Enables dual scanning tools to run legitimately in production monitoring or diagnostics contexts. |
| Flag red team or known subnet | `(UserTag = RedTeam AND DeviceTag = Lab) OR (IP in 10.50.0.0/16)` | Differentiates between red team simulation traffic and known subnet ranges during exercises. |
| PCI rules with finance exceptions | `(DeviceGroup = PCI) OR (DeviceGroup = Finance AND FileSigner = "Intuit")` | Ensures strict policies for PCI assets, while allowing specific financial applications in finance-labeled devices. |

### 6.1 üîé Raw vs. Contextual Data in Alert Suppression

When configuring suppression rules, it‚Äôs essential to understand the difference between raw alert data and the contextually enriched data shown in the Alert page UX.

In the Alert page UI, Microsoft Defender XDR enriches alert data by correlating it with external telemetry sources. For instance:

- An AV detection event might initially lack the ProcessName or ImageFile fields. During UI rendering, the system searches for correlated events‚Äîe.g., matching ProcessId and ProcessStartTime‚Äîto reconstruct the full process context and tree. This allows the Alert page to show a complete picture even if the raw detection was minimal.

However, this enriched data is not supported in Alert Tuning. The reason is:

- Suppression rules are evaluated against the raw alert payload, not the UI-enriched view.
- If the rule is built using enriched fields (like ProcessName), but those fields don‚Äôt exist in the raw event, the alert won‚Äôt be suppressed, even though it appears to match in the UI.
- This could lead to false expectations and missed suppression.

üß† **Tip**: Use Autofill when creating suppression rules to identify the exact raw fields that are guaranteed to be present in the alert payload.

- Autofill presents only data available at evaluation time.
- This helps avoid suppression rules based on fields that will never match.
- Always validate additional conditions manually by comparing with a raw alert sample.

![A screenshot Showing the location of the auto-fill feature in alert tunning.](https://github.com/Arkthos/The-Escalation-Protocol/blob/main/Wiki%20snapshots/Image%20(11).png)

üå± **Contextual Suppression ‚Äî Future Direction**: While not currently available, there is a long-term vision to support contextual suppression. This would allow:

- Evaluating suppression rules after alert enrichment, using a more complete set of fields.
- More accurate, high-confidence suppression based on correlated telemetry (e.g., process trees, signer info, command line context).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is not an active feature and is not prioritized in the current roadmap.

## üõ° 8. Governance & Risk Mitigation

| ‚úîÔ∏è Practice | üìã Guideline | üìö Reference / Application Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Naming Convention | Use consistent, descriptive names. Example: LT-Infrastructure-PsExec-Resolve. Include team/intent for traceability. | üìò CIS Control 6.7: Maintain detailed records of system and software configuration. Helps with audit trail and rule lineage. |
| Documentation | Use the Comments field to record business justification, scope, and author. | üìö NIST 800-53 AU-3: Maintain accountability for changes affecting monitoring systems. |
| Review Cadence | Monthly: Review alert volume for tuning saturation or ineffectiveness. Quarterly: Assess rule relevance, missed detections, or outdated exceptions. | üîÅ MITRE ATT&CK Feedback Loop & CIS Control 8: Validate detections periodically to prevent blind spots. |
| Rollback Strategy | Start tuning actions with Resolve. Promote to Hide only after validating no legitimate alerts are being suppressed. Revert if necessary. | üõë Change Management Best Practice: Always retain a rollback path; akin to canary deployments in DevOps. |
| Automation for Awareness | Use Power Automate (or similar SOAR tools) to trigger notifications (e.g., Teams, email) when high-volume rules activate unexpectedly. | ü§ñ CIS Control 16.10: Alert personnel when anomalies exceed defined thresholds. Ensures visibility into over-tuned rules. |

## üß∞ 9. Troubleshooting & Pitfalls

| ‚ùì Issue | üß≠ Likely Cause | üõ† Suggested Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rule saved but still fires alert | Field mismatch or unindexed property | Compare with raw payload; check syntax and case |
| Unexpected alerts suppressed | Rule too broad or loosely scoped | Tighten scope, use nested sub-groups |
| Missing DeviceTag | Tag assigned after alert generation | Ensure tagging occurs before activity |
| Rule not visible in UI | Missing permissions or wrong license | Verify role = Security Admin + Defender Plan 2 |
| Rule appears correct but fails | Based on enriched-only field | Rely on Autofill; cross-check with raw event fields |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 10. System Limits & Edge Cases

- **Max conditions per sub-group**: 20
- **Wildcard support**:
  - `*` = multiple characters
  - `?` = single character
- **Regex**: ‚ùå Not supported

üõ° **Supported Alert Sources**:

- ‚úÖ Defender for Endpoint
- ‚úÖ Defender for Office 365
- ‚úÖ Defender for Identity
- ‚úÖ Defender for Cloud Apps

üö´ **Unsupported**:

- Custom Detection Rules (KQL-based)
  - Although you may see custom detection alerts in the Alert Tuning wizard, these are not officially supported by Microsoft for tuning actions.
  - **Key reasons**:
    - Custom alerts lack required metadata (e.g., DetectionSource, RuleId, Category) that the tuning system depends on.
    - Actions like "Hide" or "Resolve" may appear to work but often fail silently or behave unpredictably.
    - These scenarios are not supported by Microsoft; issues with tuning custom detections will not be investigated by support.
  - **Recommendation**: If you need suppression-like control for custom detections, refine the logic in the KQL query or apply routing filters in the incident queue settings.
